1.What is JSX?
->JSX is HTML like syntax used to make writing code in React easy(syntax extension to Javascript)

2.Superpowers of JSX

ii)Easy to write = HTML like syntax and much better when compared to React.createElement way

3.Role of type attribute in script tag. What options can I use there?
->script type attribute can have values: modules, importmap, blocking
i)If the script is Javascript code, then its encouraged that we omit the type attribute to indicate the scrit as JS only
ii)module: This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module.
Unlike classic scripts, module scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for cross-origin fetching

4.{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
->{TitleComponent} - Functions are not valid as a React child warning is thrown and its not rendered
To render it, call the functional component like this {TitleComponent()}
{<TitleComponent/>} - Will render that functional component, 
<TitleComponent/> intern gets converted to React.createElemnt() which is written in JS syntax inside {}
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} - Will render that functional component
<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> intern gets converted to React.createElemnt(),
which is written in JS syntax inside {}
